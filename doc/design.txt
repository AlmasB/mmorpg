MAX_LEVEL = 100, 100, 60

lvl (base, stat, job)

                    skill points start here
       (10, 10, 10) |       (40, 45, 30)             (90, 90, 60)

Novice              -> Warrior        -> Crusader     -> Paladin
                                      -> Gladiator    -> Knight
                    -> Scout          -> Rogue        -> Assassin
                                      -> Ranger       -> Hunter
                    -> Mage           -> Wizard       -> Archmage
                                      -> Enchanter    -> Sage
                                      
when class changes to tier 1
players get reduced skill set ~4 skills of their class
once they change to tier 2 jobs they get the rest ~5 skills
tier 3 jobs don't offer new skills but better attributes/stats bonuses

skills in total = 3*4 + 6*5 = 12 + 30 = 42
currently we've got 27

we now need to reallocate skills properly and add new ones

things like life steal, extra passives (more dmg if target hp <)
can be done thru status effects and then check when attacking on server side
